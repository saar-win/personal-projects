# Made to create a database backup through the discord channel
#
1. The communication with the bot happens by private message.
2. The bot checks if who asks for backup are a valid user from the user list.
3. If so, the bot will get into the backup process behind the scenes.
4. When the backup is ready, the bot will send a message on the discord channel (general).
